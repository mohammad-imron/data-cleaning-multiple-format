This are pretty easy to deal with in R: you can read them into a dataframe using the `read.csv()` function (or `read_csv()` if you're using the tidyverse). But other data formats, in particular .json, .txt and .xls(x), can be a little trickier to read into R. \n","\n","Before we dive in to how to handle these different formats, let's quickly talk about some of the different types of data you might encounter. In general, different types of data are stored in different file types because they have different structures. This also means that they are best represented with different data structures once you do read them into R. \n","\n","* **Tabular data** is basically a spreadsheet format like what you'd see in Excel or Google Sheets. It has rows and columns. Often, each row will be a single observation and each column will be a specific variable. The same variables will be recorded for each observation (or else you have empty columns in some rows).\n","    * File formats: .csv, .tsv, .xls, .xlsx\n","    * R data structure(s): dataframe, matrix (if all numeric)\n","* **Hierarchical data** is data format where values can be nested within each other. With hierarchical data structures, you can have different information about each observation. You generally want to try to avoid trying to \"flatten\" hierarchical data into a tabular data structure because it's often not space efficient. For example, if you have a dataset of food products and clothes products, you probably want to know the expiration date for the food and the clothing size for the clothes. In a hierarchical structure you don't need to specify that you don't know the size for the food or the expiration date for the clothes, but in a tabular data structure you would.  As a result, you'd end up with a lot of NA cells that aren't very informative and waste space.\n","    * File formats: .json, .xml\n","    * R data structure(s): list\n","* **Raw text data** is just that: raw text that doesn't have a specific data structure specified in the format of the file. This type of data is also called \"unstructured\". \n","    * File format: .txt\n","    * R data structure(s): character string\n","\n","![](https://i.imgur.com/6XIfG0o.png)\n","\n","**OK, so why does this matter?** The reason I started by talking about the differences between these types of data is because I want to make it clear that there's a bigger difference between these file formats than just the letters at the end. Different file formats also reflect differences in how the underlying data is structured. In some cases you can convert between the different types of files (for example, if you have the same fields for each object in a .json file and no nested values you can safely convert it to a .csv) but generally it's more space efficient to use a data structure that makes sense given the way the original data was organized.\n","\n","In other words **the first step to reading a dataset into R is to understand how it's organized and what type of data structure you should use to store it**. Fortunately, the functions we'll be working with today are pretty smart about how they handle data and can do a lot of the guessing for us.\n","\n","\n","## Your turn!\n","\n","Check out each of these three datasets (hint: look in the Data tab so that you can see a quick preview of each dataset) and decide whether the dataset is tabular, hierarchical or raw text data. \n","\n","* [Reddit Memes Dataset: A collection of the latest memes from the various meme subreddits](https://www.kaggle.com/sayangoswami/reddit-memes-dataset/data)\n","* [Emoji sentiment: Are people that use emoji happier?](https://www.kaggle.com/harriken/emoji-sentiment)\n","* [Aristo MINI Corpus: 1,197,377 science-relevant sentences drawn from public data](https://www.kaggle.com/allenai/aristo-mini-corpus)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"354de710-8f4a-456c-8b35-c49b98046de7","_uuid":"a1c49edea48e9e1514f93694a4808f623d3a9ab1"},"source":["Reddit Memes dataset : Hierarchical Data\n","\n","Emoji Sentiment : Tabular Data\n","\n","Aristo MINI Corpus : Raw Text"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"07ca03d1-0218-4743-ac1a-248691c6868d","_uuid":"253c83f0d002be6b7834f896337ad3b9d74150d5"},"source":["# Json Files\n","___\n","\n","JSON files generally represent hierarchical  data structures.

If the file's on Kaggle, you can just look at the Data tab for that dataset ([like this one](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/character-encoding-examples/data)) to see what it looks like. If you're working locally, you can try opening it in a text editor ([like Gedit](https://github.com/GNOME/gedit)) or printing a few lines of the file to your console using `head`.

I personally prefer to read text files in line-by-line, partly because this is usually what I do in Python and I like to keep my workflows in the two language as parallel as possible. To read in files by lines, I use the `read_lines`function from the tidyverse collection of packages.
